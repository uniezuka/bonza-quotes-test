A simple quote request form via shortcode with an admin page to review and approve/reject submissions.

== Description ==

Bonza Quote Form lets you collect quote requests on any page using a shortcode and manage them from the WordPress admin.

Features:

* Frontend shortcode `[bonza_quote_form]` with fields: Name, Email, Service Type, Notes
* Saves submissions to a custom database table with status `pending`
* Admin page “Bonza Quotes” to list, search, paginate, and approve/reject submissions
* Security best practices: nonces, capability checks, prepared statements, output escaping
* Translation-ready (`bonza_quote` text domain)
* Developer hooks and filters for extensibility

Admin UI overview:

- Go to “Bonza Quotes” in the admin sidebar to view all submissions
- Use the search box (top-right) to search by name, email, or service type
- Use the row actions to Approve or Reject a submission
- Pagination controls appear below the list when there are many items

How it works:

* On activation, the plugin creates a table `{$wpdb->prefix}bonza_quotes` to store submissions
* Visitors submit the form; valid entries are saved as `pending` and a success message is shown
* Administrators can approve or reject entries from the “Bonza Quotes” menu
* On new submission, the site admin receives an email notification (subject and body are filterable)

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `bonza_quote` folder to `/wp-content/plugins/` or install via the WordPress Plugins screen
2. Activate the plugin through the “Plugins” menu
3. Create or edit a page and add the shortcode: `[bonza_quote_form]`
4. View and manage submissions in “Bonza Quotes” in the admin sidebar

== Usage ==

Shortcode: `[bonza_quote_form]`

Behavior:

* After submission, the user is redirected back with a success or error message
* Submissions are saved as `pending`; admins can change status to `approved` or `rejected`

Customize service types:

Developers can filter the Service Type options shown in the form using the `bonza_quote/service_types` filter.

Example (add to a small custom plugin or your theme’s `functions.php`):

```
add_filter( 'bonza_quote/service_types', function( $types ) {
    return array( 'General Inquiry', 'Web Design', 'SEO', 'Maintenance', 'Consulting' );
} );
```

Database schema:

The plugin creates a table named `{$wpdb->prefix}bonza_quotes` with the following columns:

- `id` bigint unsigned, primary key, auto-increment
- `name` varchar(191) not null
- `email` varchar(191) not null
- `service_type` varchar(100) not null
- `notes` text null
- `status` varchar(20) not null default `pending`
- `created_at` datetime not null
- `updated_at` datetime not null

Indexes:

- Key on `status`
- Key on `created_at`

Developer hooks:

* Action: `bonza_quote/submitted` fires after a quote is saved — params: `(int $quote_id, array $data)`
* Action: `bonza_quote/status_changed` fires when status changes — params: `(int $quote_id, string $old, string $new)`

Email filters:

* Filter: `bonza_quote/admin_email_subject` — `(string $subject, int $quote_id, array $data)`
* Filter: `bonza_quote/admin_email_body` — `(string $body, int $quote_id, array $data)`

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where do I see the submissions? =

Go to “Bonza Quotes” in the WordPress admin.

= Can I change the service type list? =

Yes. Use the `bonza_quote/service_types` filter shown above.

= Does uninstall remove data? =

Yes. Uninstall drops the custom table `{$wpdb->prefix}bonza_quotes`.

Uninstall behavior:

- When the plugin is uninstalled (not merely deactivated), it drops the `bonza_quotes` table.
- This is handled in `uninstall.php`. Ensure `WP_UNINSTALL_PLUGIN` is defined by uninstalling via WordPress Plugins screen.

== Screenshots ==

1. Frontend quote form
2. Admin list table with approve/reject actions

== Changelog ==

= 1.0.0 =
* Initial release: shortcode form, custom table, admin list with approve/reject, basic search and pagination

== Development: Running Tests ==

This repository includes a minimal PHPUnit setup focused on unit-testing the repository and activation SQL without requiring a full WordPress bootstrap.

Prerequisites:

1. PHP 8.0+ recommended
2. Composer installed

Install dependencies and run tests:

```
composer install
composer test
```

Or, run PHPUnit directly (if installed globally):

```
phpunit
```

Notes:

- The tests use a lightweight fake `$wpdb` and small shims for common WP functions.
- No database is created; SQL is captured from the activation routine for verification.
